🔹 How Tables Are Connected

SQL mein connections Foreign Keys (FK) se bante hain.
Example:

Ek Branch ek Company ka hissa hoti hai → branch.company_id (FK)

Ek Department ek Branch ka hissa hoti hai → department.branch_id (FK)

Ek Employee ek Department ka hissa hota hai → employee.department_id (FK)
